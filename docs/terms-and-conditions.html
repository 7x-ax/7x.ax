For the avoidance of doubt, Customer will remain responsible for payment of fees during any suspension period under this Section 9.3.

The parties acknowledge that disclosing Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so on breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">11. 7x TECHNOLOGY.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">11.1 Ownership and Updates.

Other than the 7x Code, the 7x Service is offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any 7x Service and that 7x at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications or improvements to the 7x Service from time-to-time.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">11.2 Feedback.

INDEMNIFICATION.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">Customer agrees to defend and indemnify 7x from and against any third-party claims and liabilities to the extent resulting from: Customer Data; Customer Properties (including services or products provided through the Customer Properties); or a breach or alleged breach of Section 6 (Customer Obligations). Customer must not settle any claim without 7x’s prior written consent if the settlement would require 7x to admit fault, pay amounts that Customer must pay under this Agreement, or take or refrain from taking any action. 7x may participate in a claim through counsel of its own choosing at its own expense and Customer and 7x will reasonably cooperate on the defense.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">13.

Customer must send any notices under this Agreement (including breach notices) to 7x, in English, at the following address, legal@7x.net, and include “Attn. Legal Department” in the subject line. 7x may send notices to the email addresses on Customer’s account or, at 7x’s option, to Customer’s last-known postal address. 7x may also provide operational notices regarding the 7x Service or other business-related notices through conspicuous posting of the notice on 7x’s website or the 7x Service. Each party consents to receiving electronic notices. 7x is not responsible for any automatic filtering Customer or its network provider may apply to email notifications.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">16.3 Publicity. 7x may not use Customer’s name, logo, and marks for its marketing purposes unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order Form or with Customer’s prior written permission.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">16.4 Subcontractors. 7x may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to 7x in order to provide the 7x Service and related services under this Agreement. These subcontractors may include, for example, 7x’s hosted service and CDN providers. However, subject to all terms and conditions of this Agreement, 7x will remain responsible for: (i) compliance of its subcontractors with the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) the overall performance of the 7x Services if and as required under this Agreement.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">16.5 Subpoenas. Nothing in this Agreement prevents 7x from disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but 7x will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer where permitted to do so.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">16.6 Independent Contractors. The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors, and this Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship. Neither party has the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party’s behalf without the other party’s prior written consent.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">16.7 Force Majeure. Neither party will be liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligation under this Agreement (except payment obligations) if the delay or failure is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or reduction of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or government act.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">16.8 Export. Customer is responsible for obtaining any required export or import authorizations for use of the 7x Services. Customer represents and warrants that it, its Affiliates, and its Authorized Users are not on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties or located in (or a national of) a country subject to a U.S. government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country. Customer must not access or use the 7x Service in violation of any U.S. export embargo, prohibition or restriction.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">16.9 Amendments; Waivers. Any modification or amendment to this Agreement must be made in writing and executed by an authorized representative of each party. However, if 7x modifies the Agreement or any applicable Service-Specific Terms during Customer’s Subscription Term, the modified version will take effect upon Customer’s next Subscription Term renewal. In addition: (a) If 7x launches new products or optional features that require opt-in acceptance of new terms, those terms will apply upon Customer’s acceptance or use; (b) changes to any terms will take effect immediately for Free Access Subscriptions; and (c) during a Subscription Term, 7x may update 7x’s Security page, Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy from time-to-time to reflect process improvements or changing practices, and these changes will take effect thirty (30) days from the date of posting so long as they do not substantially diminish Customer’s rights or create substantial additional Customer obligations during a Subscription Term. 7x’s Documentation is available online and constantly being developed and improved, and as a result, during a Subscription Term 7x may update the Documentation to reflect best practice with the relevant 7x Service, provided that these changes do not substantially diminish Customer’s rights or create substantial Customer obligations. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any Order Form, this Agreement will take precedence unless otherwise expressly provided. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement. Waivers must be made in writing and executed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">16.10 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement may otherwise remain in effect.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">16.11 No Third-Party Rights. Nothing in this Agreement confers on any third party the right to enforce any provision of this Agreement. Customer acknowledges that each Order Form only permits use by and for the legal entity or entities identified in the Order Form(s) as the Customer, and not any Customer Affiliates.</p><p class="mt-4 text-lg tracking-tight text-slate-700">16.12 Entire Agreement. This Agreement represents the parties’ complete and exclusive understanding relating to the Agreement’s subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the 7x Technology or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. The terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods do not apply to this Agreement. Any terms provided by Customer (including as part of any purchase order or other business form used by Customer) are for administrative purposes only, and have no legal effect.</p></div></div></section></main><footer class="bg-slate-50"><div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"><div class="py-16"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="66"
